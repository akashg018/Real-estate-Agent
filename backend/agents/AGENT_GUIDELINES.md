# Bad Response
"Error processing request. Please rephrase."
```

### 4. Context Sharing

## Common Scenarios and Responses

# Instead of error message:

1. What type of property you're looking for
2. Your preferred location
3. Your budget range"
```

### Missing Information
```python
# Instead of "Error: Missing property ID":
"I see you're interested in the amenities. Which of our discussed properties would you like to know more about?"
```

### Information Updates
```python
# When new information conflicts with old:
"I notice the price range we discussed earlier was $X. Let me make sure we have the most up-to-date information..."
